# NgxTodo

Project carried out for university subject. Implementation of simple to-do list using Angular 7.2.0. Main purpose of the project was to handle simple logic such as creating, modyfing and creating lists, adding tasks, marking tasks as completed or partially completed, viewing archive, changing language and registering new accounts (with their own data). Due to requirements I decided not to use any styling library such as Bootstrap or Angular Material. 

## What could have been done better | What can be implemented in the future

- better look / styling / css (using Angular Material probably)
- sorting lists
- customizing lists (icons, dates, notifications and etc.)
- better committs (finishing one task at the time, then commit and so on - good for bigger projects)
- change simple firebase connection to client-server application (with backend written in Java for example - Spring Boot with OAuth2 security or at least some JWT Token)

## What I've learned:

- how to build and structure simple angular projekt using Angular CLI
- how to style elements without using third-party libraries such as Angular Material or Bootstrap
- how to plug and use ngx-translations in simple angular project
- how google firebase works
- how to make better commits 
- general stuff in Angular (components, lazy loading, guards, pipes, subjects and etc.)
- that project, commits and any other stuff should be written in english
